    <p>There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. “Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,” thought Alice; “only, as it’s asleep, I suppose it doesn’t mind.”</p>
    <p>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: “No room! No room!” they cried out when they saw Alice coming. <a href="#" data-toggle="popover" data-content="There really wasn't room">“There’s plenty of room!”</a> said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.</p>

              <li>“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.</li>
              <li>“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Alice angrily.</li>
              <li>“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,” said the March Hare.</li>
              <li>“I didn’t know it was your table,” said Alice; “it’s laid for a great many more than three.”</li>
              <li>“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.</li>
